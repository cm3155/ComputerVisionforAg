### Description
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), plant pests and diseases cause about 40 percent of annual crop losses. Such losses are not only detrimental to farmers, but also to the communities with which they provide vital resources. In this project, I seek to accurately and consistently identify diseases in plant leaf images. 

### Intended Use
This model is for educational purposes. Any usage other than for education or learning is out-of-scope.
